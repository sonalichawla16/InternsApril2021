Call -> In Javascript with the call() method you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
Apply -> Apply method also works but the only difference is using the apply method the passing arguments could be an array, refer below code.
Bind -> bind method returns a method instance instead of result value, after that need to execute a bound method with arguments.

Here's the example of all the three above

var obj={
   num : 2
}
var add = function(num2,num3,num4){
   return this.num + num2 + num3 + num4;
}
var arr=[3,4,5];
//Call method 
console.log(add.call(obj,3,4,5));  //Output : 14
//Apply method
console.log(add.apply(obj,arr));   //Output : 14
//bind Method
var bound = add.bind(obj);
console.log(bound(3,4,5));
