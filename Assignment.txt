Q1 - Call Vs Apply Vs Bind ?

Ans- The bind method creates a copy of the function and sets the this keyword, while the call and apply methods sets 
the this keyword and calls the function immediately.
The only difference between how they work is that call() expects all parameters to be passed in individually, 
whereas apply() expects an array of all of our parameters.
